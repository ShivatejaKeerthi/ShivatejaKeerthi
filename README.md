### My Tech Stack
- **Front-End**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Tools & DevOps**: Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, RESTful APIs, GraphQL

### What Iâ€™m Currently Learning
- Advanced **React** patterns and state management
- Delving into **Serverless** architecture and cloud technologies (AWS, Firebase)
- Enhancing my skills in **UI/UX Design** to improve user experience



## ðŸŒ± My Learning Path

Iâ€™m always seeking new challenges and ways to improve my skills. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what Iâ€™ve learned so far and what Iâ€™m actively diving into:

1. **Front-End Development**: Mastered HTML/CSS/JavaScript, now expanding into React & Vue.js to create more interactive UIs.
2. **Back-End Development**: Working with Node.js and Express for server-side programming and building RESTful APIs.
3. **Databases**: Gaining proficiency in relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases to handle different data storage needs.
4. **DevOps & Deployment**: Learning Docker and cloud platforms like AWS to streamline deployment.
